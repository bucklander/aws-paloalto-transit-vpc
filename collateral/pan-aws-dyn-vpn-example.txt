! IPSec Tunnel #2
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption, 
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address. 
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall !rules to unblock UDP port 4500. If not behind NAT, we recommend disabling NAT-T.

! With local-address IP please append the configured subnet mask (i.e, /30) on the VPN initiating interface (i.e., ethernet 1/1)
! For example if you have /30 as subnet mask the local-address ip should be 52.15.228.69/30

! #2: IPSec Configuration
! 
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
!
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!  
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated  
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be 
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
! Association with the IPSec security association is done through the 
! "tunnel protection" command.
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your 
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN 
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.
!

! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway    
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!            
!
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65123)
! is configured as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must 
! be changed, the Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.

! Your gateway can advertise a default route 0.0.0.0/0 to AWS VPC for which you would need to create a
! redistribution profile as follows, allow redistribution of default route and finally

! LAN-CIDR is an object which contains your Local LAN IP addresses.
! VPC-CIDR is an object which contains your VPC CIDR addresses.
! If your VPC-CIDR is 10.0.0.0/16, you can configure an object using the following:
! 
! set address VPC-CIDR ip-netmask 10.0.0.0/16
! set address LAN-CIDR ip-netmask 192.168.0.0/16
!


  
! If tunnel and LAN side network interfaces are in different security zones, 
! we need to configure NAT examption and put at the top, so that actual IP sources
! show up on the VPC side for proper route back via tunnel as follows when 
! LAN side zone is considered as "trust" and tunnel interface being part of "untrust" zone, 
! please change accordingly:
!
  
edit rulebase nat
  set rules No_NAT_LAN_VPC to untrust
  set rules No_NAT_LAN_VPC from trust
  set rules No_NAT_LAN_VPC source LAN-CIDR
  set rules No_NAT_LAN_VPC destination VPC-CIDR
  set rules No_NAT_LAN_VPC service any
  set rules No_NAT_LAN_VPC disabled no
 top
 move rulebase nat rules No_NAT_LAN_VPC top  
  
! *** NOTE *** : 
! If tunnel and LAN side network interfaces are in the different security zones,
! we need to configure a firewall policy to allow inter-zone communication as well.
! You can use VPC-CIDR/LAN-CIDR object groups to create firewall policy as well.
!
! Please also note that you will need to commit the configuration using "commit" command.
